## 📖 What is HILL-CIPHER?

HILL-CIPHER is an easy-to-use tool that helps you protect your messages with encryption. It uses the Hill cipher, a classic method that turns your plain text into secure code. Behind the scenes, it uses math to lock and unlock your messages. You don’t need to know math or coding to use it.

This application shows each step clearly with live math formulas and animations. It helps you understand how encryption works while keeping your data safe. HILL-CIPHER runs in your web browser using Streamlit, with powerful math handled by NumPy and SymPy.
